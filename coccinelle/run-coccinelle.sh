# FIXME:
#   - Coccinelle doesn't like our TEST() macros, which then causes name conflicts; i.e. Cocci can't process
#     that TEST(xsetxattr) yields test_xsetxattr() and uses just xsetxattr() in this case, which then conflicts
#     with the tested xsetxattr() function, leading up to the whole test case getting skipped due to
#     conflicting typedefs
#   - something keeps pulling in src/boot/efi/*.h stuff, even though it's excluded
#   - Coccinelle has issues with some of our more complex macros

# Exclude following paths from the Coccinelle transformations

    # A couple of notes:
    #
    # 1) Limit this to 10 files at once, as processing the ASTs is _very_ memory hungry - e.g. with 20 files
    # at once one spatch process can take around 2.5 GiB of RAM, which can easily eat up all available RAM
    # when paired together with parallel
    #
    # 2) Make sure spatch can find our includes via -I <dir>, similarly as we do when compiling stuff
    #
    # 3) Make sure to include includes from includes (--recursive-includes), but use them only to get type
    # definitions (--include-headers-for-types) - otherwise we'd start formatting them as well, which might
    # be unwanted, especially for includes we fetch verbatim from third-parties
    #
    # 4) Use cache, since generating the full AST is _very_ expensive, i.e. the uncached run takes 15 - 30
    # minutes (for one rule(!)), vs 30 - 90 seconds when the cache is populated. One major downside of the
    # cache is that it's quite big - ATTOW the cache takes around 15 GiB, but the performance boost is
    # definitely worth it
