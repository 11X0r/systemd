The systemd project uses a single line reference to Unique License Identifiers
in source files as defined by the Linux Foundation's SPDX project
(https://spdx.org/).

The current set of valid, predefined SPDX identifiers can be found on the SPDX
License List at https://spdx.org/licenses/.

The 'license/' directory contains all the licenses used by the sources included
in the systemd project source tree.

Unless otherwise noted, the systemd project sources are licensed under the terms
and conditions of the "GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later".

The following exceptions apply:

 * the udev sources are licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later
 * the header files contained in src/basic/linux/ and src/shared/linux/ are
   copied verbatim from the Linux kernel source tree and are licensed under
   GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note and are used within the scope of the
   Linux-syscall-note exception, and thus their license does not affect the rest
   of the source code/binaries
 * the src/shared/initreq.h header is licensed under original license,
   LGPL-2.0-or-later.
 * the src/shared/linux/bpf_insn.h header is copied from the Linux kernel
   source tree and is licensed under either BSD-2-Clause or GPL-2.0-only,
   and thus is included in the systemd build under the BSD-2-Clause license.
 * The src/basic/linux/wireguard.h header is copied from the Linux kernel
   source tree and is licensed under either MIT or GPL-2.0 WITH
   Linux-syscall-note, and thus is included in the systemd build under the MIT
   license.
 * the following sources are licensed under the MIT license:
   - hwdb.d/parse_hwdb.py
   - man/glib-event-glue.c
   - src/basic/linux/batman_adv.h
   - src/basic/sparse-endian.h
   - tools/catalog-report.py
 * the following sources are licensed under the CC0-1.0 license:
   - src/basic/siphash24.c
   - src/basic/siphash24.h
   - src/systemctl/systemd-sysv-install.SKELETON
   - tools/check-includes.pl
 * the following sources are licensed under the LicenseRef-murmurhash2-public-domain:
   - src/basic/MurmurHash2.c
   - src/basic/MurmurHash2.h
 * the following sources are licensed under the LicenseRef-lookup3-public-domain:
   - src/libsystemd/sd-journal/lookup3.c
   - src/libsystemd/sd-journal/lookup3.h

OpenSSL notes

Note that when building the systemd project with OpenSSL 3.0, the resulting
binaries that link with libssl/libcrypto have to effectively be distributed
under LGPL-3.0-or-later to be compatible with OpenSSL's Apache2 license.
This does not affect the libsystemd.so shared library, which will not link
with OpenSSL 3.0 and thus can still be distributed under LGPL-2.1-or-later
in all cases, so that external programs linking to it are guaranteed to be
unaffected.

Sources that cannot be distributed under LGPL-2.1-or-later will no longer
be accepted for inclusion in the systemd project to maintain this compatibility.
