description from the pull request:

This PR introduces `ExitType=main|cgroup` for services. Similar to how `Type`
specifies the launch of a service, `ExitType` is concerned with how systemd
determines that a service exited.

- If set to `main` (the current behavior), the service manager will consider
  the unit stopped when the main process exits.

- The `cgroup` exit type is meant for applications whose forking model is not
  known ahead of time and which might not have a specific main process. The
  service will stay running as long as at least one process in the cgroup is
  running. The exit status of the service is that of the last process in the
  cgroup to exit. This is intended for transient or automatically generated
  services, such as graphical applications inside of a desktop environment.

Motivation for this is #16805. `xdg-autostart-generator` was amended to use
`ExitType=cgroup`, which fixes https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433299, a
bug where some generated autostart app services that forked not launching
(systemd kills the entire cgroup after the main process exited).
