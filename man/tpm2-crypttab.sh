sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=7 /dev/sdXn

# Test: Let's run systemd-cryptsetup to test if this worked.
sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-cryptsetup attach mytest /dev/sdXn - tpm2-device=auto

# If that worked, let's now add the same line persistently to /etc/crypttab,
# for the future. We don't want to use the (unstable) /dev/sdX name, so let's
# figure out a stable link:
udevadm info -q -r symlink /dev/sdXn

# Now add the line using the by-uuid symlink to /etc/crypttab:
sudo bash -c 'echo "mytest /dev/disk/by-uuid/... - tpm2-device=auto" >>/etc/crypttab'

# Depending on your distribution and encryption setup, you may need to manually
# regenerate your initramfs to be able to use a TPM2 security chip to unlock
# the partition during early boot.
