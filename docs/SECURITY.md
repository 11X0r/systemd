# Reporting of Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, we'd appreciate a non-public disclosure. systemd developers can be contacted privately on the **[systemd-security@redhat.com](mailto:systemd-security@redhat.com) mailing list**. The disclosure will be coordinated with distributions.

(The [issue tracker](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues) and [systemd-devel mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel) are fully public.)
