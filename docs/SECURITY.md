# Reporting of security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, we'd appreciate a non-public disclosure. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues) and [systemd-devel mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel) are fully public. If you need to reach systemd developers in a non-public way, report the issue to the [systemd-security@redhat.com](mailto:systemd-security@redhat.com) mailing list. The disclosure will be coordinated with distributions.

To subscribe to [systemd-security@redhat.com](mailto:systemd-security@redhat.com) please submit subscribe request, but also reach out to the list administrators (@keszybz, @msekletar and @lnykryn) and send us a short justification why you need access to the list.
