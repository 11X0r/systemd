# Old multipathd.service pulls deprecated systemd-udev-settle.service, and it
# may timeout on a slow CI environment. We manually start the service in
# TEST-64-UDEV-STORAGE, hence it is not to necessary enable it by default.
# Note, in the upstream, the dependency was removed by
# https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/commit/c9689b678f53a468be0af0b6fdcd0538ccf635cb
disable multipathd.service

# The socket unit is disabled by default in the upstream:
# https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/commit/346e9adda4e5f0ccfcbb7a3eccf5f96001d95027
disable multipathd.socket
